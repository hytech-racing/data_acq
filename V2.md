after struggling a lot with the big ass architecture of this boi using co-routines, im gonna try to switch to a threaded architecture as i know that it will give me what I want directly. I should be able to use pretty much the same architecture, just with different tools cuz ive been treating co-routines like they are threads and it hasnt really been working lol.

multi-threaded handling:

1 thread for all input data that handles receiving, parsing streaming and logging
	inputs:
		- CAN data
		- UDP data
	- will check for CAN messages and / or UDP messages, parse them into protobuf messages and put them into the output queue
	- will append to a SINGLE queue the data
1 thread for handling the streaming of the data into foxglove and the mcap file and output the current parameter / config that gets parsed from the data queue
	- will consume the main data queue coming from the interface producers 

    - will consume another queue coming from the web interface
	- will maintain part of the asyncio infrastructure in that the foxglove webserver in that the mcap writer and the foxglove webserver will be in two different tasks
	- will look to see if the incoming data is a parameter message (or some other msg that the frontend needs) and will output it to the frontend data queue

1 thread for handling the website and the display state 
	- will wait for the following to trigger a run of the processes:
		- frontend data queue data receive
		- user input from the website
	- will consume the frontend data queue 
	- will handle the user interaction
	- will handle the serving of the website
	- will append to the output data queue data created by the user (config change, etc.)
    
1 thread for the output data to all desired interfaces
	- will wait on a queue and upon notification it will wake up and output the data from the queue to the correct interface


tools I will use:

`threading.Condition()`

condition will be used in the website handling thread 
```python
import threading

class OddEvenPrinter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.lock = threading.Lock()
        self.condition = threading.Condition(self.lock)
        self.number = 1

    def print_odd(self):
        for _ in range(10):
            with self.condition:
                while self.number % 2 == 0:
                    self.condition.wait()
                print("Odd:", self.number)
                self.number += 1
                self.condition.notify()

    def print_even(self):
        for _ in range(10):
            with self.condition:
                while self.number % 2 != 0:
                    self.condition.wait()
                print("Even:", self.number)
                self.number += 1
                self.condition.notify()

printer = OddEvenPrinter()

odd_thread = threading.Thread(target=printer.print_odd)
even_thread = threading.Thread(target=printer.print_even)

odd_thread.start()
even_thread.start()

odd_thread.join()
even_thread.join()

print("Printing finished")
```
